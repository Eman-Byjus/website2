                Legacy
Started in 2013 with the goal to serve the right combination of ingredients in the appropriate quantity in order to produce the finest cuisines in an authentic environment and service.

Asia Darbar, a brain child of the third generation Mr. XYZ Managing Director-Persian Darbar and grandson of Mr. ABC founders of Persian Darbar.

Ingredients are essential to the flavor of any platter, and we always preserve the taste with the appropriate quantity and quality. As the Khansamas (Chef) belong to the dynasty of the Moghuls the taste and flavours are traditional and authentic.

Asia darbar began with new thoughts and ideas which made it a pioneer in various food specialities including Mughlai, Punjabi, Chinese, Sea Food cuisines and not the least Raan. Being awarded the title of "Raan King" this dish can be cooked in 10 different variants. The restaurant is split between the Darbar Hall and the Galeecha in two lovely parts.

Galeecha - The idea of galeecha came to the owners with a thought of togetherness, comfort sitting and the experience of a family dining together at one big table.

Our biggest strength is our Loyal Guest's unconditional love, which helped us to expand from a single outlet to five outlets across the western suburbs of Mumbai.

Our vision -Asia Darbar's taste, quality and service is our greatest asset and the reason why we have achieved success is the loyalty of our guests.

Feel free to email me at founder@persiadarbar.com for any suggestions, feedback or grievances. I will be pleased to hear you.

~ XYZ
